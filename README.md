## Overview

Welcome to the project documentation for an innovative addition to the world of mini golf: a High-Speed Golf Ball Shooter. This project began with a simple yet ambitious goal: to enhance the traditional golfing experience, particularly in the realm of putting. Our initial vision was to develop a tool that would assist golfers in refining their putting skills in a competitive and engaging manner. However, as we delved deeper into the project, our focus shifted, leading us to a more dynamic and playful interpretation of golfing aids.

**Main Reasons for Project Shift:**

1. Our motor was too powerful for the golf ball. We were unable to tune the motor speed too produce reasonable ball speeds.
2. Our RFID reader was unable to read the RFID tags on the golf balls. We were unable to find a solution to this problem that would be cost feasible with our limited budget.
